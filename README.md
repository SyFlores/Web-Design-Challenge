## Abstract
We are intending to create a website with multiple pages to display the relationship between the latitude of cities and factors such as max temperature, cloudiness, humidity, and wind speed.

## Repository
This section serves as a means to navigate the project/repository.
**WebVisualizations** will serve to house all of the contents of the project excluding the README.md

- **assets**
  - style.css
    - This will serve to be the primary stylization **css** file
  - reset.css
    - This will serve to reset stylization upon loading the pages
- **visualizations**
  - Plots as **png** files
    - This includes the comparison of latitude against max temperature, cloudiness, humidity, and wind speed
    - Additionally, these latitude values are broken up again by northern and southern hemispheres and compared again with an attempted linear regression


## Methodology
1. We will describe our methodology here in both the design of the application and the code

## Conclusion
1. We will list any and all conclusions here
